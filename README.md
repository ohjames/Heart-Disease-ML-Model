supervised machine learning

Conclusions from the EDA
There are no NaN values in the data.
There are certain outliers in all the continuous features.
The data consists of more than twice the number of people with sex = 1 than sex = 0.
There is no apparent linear correlation between continuous variable according to the heatmap.
The scatterplot heatmap matrix suggests that there might be some correlation between output and chest pain type, max heart rate and slope.
It is intuitive that elder people might have higher chances of heart attack but according to the distribution plot of age wrt output, it is evident that this isn't the case.
According to the distribution plot of max_hr wrt output, people with higher maximum heart rate achieved have higher chances of heart attack.
According to the distribution plot of oldpeak wrt output, people with lower pevious peak achieved have higher chances of heart attack.
The plot 3.2.4 tells about the following -
People with Non-Anginal chest pain, that is with cp = 2 have higher chances of heart attack.
People with 0 major vessels, have high chance of heart attack.
People with sex = 1 have higher chance of heart attack.
People with thalium stress test = 2 have much higher chance of heart attack.
People with no exercise induced angina, that is with exercise_induced = 0 have higher chance of heart attack.
